====== coreBOS Documentation Structure ======

The wiki is divided into some top level categories like [[.usermanual|User Manual]] and [[.adminmanual|Administrator Manual]]. Each of these is divided into four additional categories:

  * **Tutorials**: These teach your users specific things that they can do with the application, and are usually tightly focused on just a few pieces of functionality. Bonus points if you include working sample code.
  * **Guides**: This is somewhere between the reference and tutorials. It should be like your reference with prose that explains how to use the application.
  * **Reference**: This is the listing of all the functionality in excruciating detail. This includes all datatype and function specifications.
  * **FAQ**: Frequently Asked Questions and Answers

There are some top level special categories like [[.installupdate|Installation]] and [[.helpmenow|HelpMeNow]] for the application inline help.
